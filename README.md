mixcloud-downloader
===================

A simple php script to find download links for the original (uncompressed) content using a mixcloud link. Made for those of us out there that can't bear to listen to 64kbit m4a. This is not intended to be used for batch downloading, and I only made it due to the pain I endure listening to their compressed content.

**IMPORTANT: No longer functional**

As of a week ago (June 2016) it would seem mixcloud have completely removed the ability to retrieve the high quality files. Was only a matter of time I guess. I've spend a while looking into this and can confirm there is no solution available.

The death of an era of high quality music. Feels like we're going backwards :back:.
